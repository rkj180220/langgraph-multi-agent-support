1. **First, check the basics:**
   - Verify all cable connections are secure
   - Ensure the device is powered on
   - Check for any error messages or indicators

2. **Troubleshooting steps:**
   - Restart the affected system/application
   - Check system logs for any errors
   - Verify network connectivity if applicable

3. **If the issue persists:**
   - Contact your system administrator
   - Document any error messages
   - Note when the issue first occurred

4. **For password-related issues:**
   - Use the self-service password reset portal
   - Contact IT help desk with proper identification
   - Follow company security policies

This solution is based on our internal IT documentation and best practices.""")

1. **For expense reporting:**
   - Submit reports within 30 days of incurring expenses
   - Attach original receipts for expenses over $25
   - Use approved expense categories
   - Obtain manager approval for expenses over $500

2. **Budget-related queries:**
   - Review budget monthly with department heads
   - Submit variance reports for deviations >10%
   - Plan next fiscal year budget 6 months in advance

3. **Payment processing:**
   - Net 30 payment terms for approved vendors
   - Require purchase orders for expenses >$1000
   - Process payments twice weekly

4. **Authorization limits:**
   - Department heads: up to $5,000
   - Directors: up to $25,000
   - VP Finance: up to $100,000
   - CFO: above $100,000

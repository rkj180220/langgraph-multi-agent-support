# Testing Guide for Multi-Agent Support System

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing strategies for the hierarchical multi-agent support system using AWS Bedrock/Claude with the new streamlined architecture.

## Architecture Changes Reflected in Tests

### üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture (Updated)**
The system now uses a streamlined 3-agent architecture:
- **Supervisor Agent**: Handles both routing AND evaluation (dual responsibility)
- **IT Agent**: Processes IT-related queries with RAG search
- **Finance Agent**: Processes finance queries with PDF-based RAG search
- **Removed**: Separate EvaluatorAgent (functionality merged into Supervisor)

### üìä **Key Testing Areas**
1. **Routing Precision**: Ensure single-domain queries don't route to "Both"
2. **Supervisor Dual Role**: Test both routing and evaluation functions
3. **Processing Path Tracking**: Verify correct workflow visualization
4. **Performance Optimization**: Validate 3-step vs 4-step processing

## Test Structure

### 1. **Unit Tests** (`tests/`)
- `test_agents.py` - Tests for SupervisorAgent (routing + evaluation), ITAgent, FinanceAgent
- `test_config.py` - Tests for configuration management
- `test_system.py` - Tests for the main system orchestration
- `test_tools.py` - Tests for web search, file reading, and RAG tools
- `test_validation.py` - Tests for input validation
- `test_orchestrator.py` - Tests for LangGraph workflow orchestration

### 2. **Integration Tests**
- End-to-end query processing with new architecture
- Vector store initialization and caching
- RAG document search functionality
- Processing path validation

### 3. **Routing Tests (Critical)**
- Single-domain classification accuracy
- Multi-domain detection (rare cases)
- Word boundary matching precision
- Fallback handling for unclear queries

### 4. **Manual Testing**
- Interactive CLI testing with processing path visualization
- Real AWS Bedrock integration testing
- Performance comparison (3-step vs 4-step)

test_cases = [
    ("How do I submit an expense report?", "Finance"),  # Should NOT route to "Both"
    ("What's the travel policy?", "Finance"),
    ("How do I reset my password?", "IT"),
    ("My computer won't start", "IT"),
    ("My computer broke and I need to submit an expense report for a new one", "Both"),  # True multi-domain
    ("Issues with both my payroll and VPN setup", "Both"),  # True multi-domain
]
```

### üîÑ **Supervisor Dual Role Tests**

```python
# Test supervisor routing capability
def test_supervisor_routing():
    # Test routing decision making
    
# Test supervisor evaluation capability  
def test_supervisor_evaluation():
    # Test response refinement
    
# Test supervisor handles both roles efficiently
def test_supervisor_dual_role_efficiency():
    # Test processing time and accuracy
```

### üìä **Processing Path Tests**

    "My computer broke and I need to submit an expense report for a new one",
    "Issues with both my payroll and VPN setup",
    "I need help with my salary AND installing new software",
]

# Unclear queries
UNCLEAR_QUERIES = [
    "What's the weather today?",
    "How do I get to the office?",
    "What's for lunch?",
]
```

    for query, expected_domain in test_queries:
        actual_domain = supervisor.route_query(query)
        if actual_domain == expected_domain:
            correct_routes += 1
    
    accuracy = correct_routes / total_queries
    assert accuracy > 0.95  # 95% accuracy threshold

## Continuous Integration

### üîÑ **CI/CD Pipeline**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
      - name: Install uv
        run: pip install uv
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync
      - name: Run tests
        run: uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src/hierarchical_multi_agent_support --cov-report=xml
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
```

### üìà **Performance Monitoring**

```python
# Monitor processing time trends
def test_performance_regression():
    # Ensure new changes don't slow down the system
    current_time = measure_processing_time()
    baseline_time = load_baseline_time()
    
    assert current_time <= baseline_time * 1.1  # Allow 10% variance
```

## Troubleshooting Test Issues

### üîß **Common Test Failures**

**Problem:** Routing tests failing with "Both" instead of single domain
**Solution:** Check the routing prompt and word boundary matching in `_parse_routing_decision()`

**Problem:** Processing path tests failing
**Solution:** Verify orchestrator workflow states and metadata tracking

**Problem:** Performance tests timing out
**Solution:** Check if vector store cache is working and optimize RAG search

**Problem:** Mock objects not behaving correctly
**Solution:** Update mock objects to match new Supervisor Agent dual-role behavior

### üîç **Debug Commands**

```bash
# Run single test with detailed output
uv run pytest tests/test_agents.py::TestSupervisorAgent::test_routing_precision -v -s

# Run with pdb debugging
uv run pytest tests/test_agents.py::TestSupervisorAgent::test_routing_precision --pdb

# Run with coverage and detailed report
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src/hierarchical_multi_agent_support --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
```

This updated testing guide now reflects the current streamlined architecture with the Supervisor Agent handling both routing and evaluation, improved routing precision, and the new processing path visualization features.
